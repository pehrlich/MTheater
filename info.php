                        nightly at 8:30 PM. Shows are an hour long
                        and composed of a series of short dance pieces in lavish traditional costume. The troupe is
                        composed of 7 dancers and 8
                        gamelan-style musicians under the direction of U Ohn Maung. The dance pieces are beautifully
                        choreographed to illustrate
                        the wide range of the court and folk dance forms that are native to Myanmar. The program changes
                        nightly and spans more
                        than 12 distinct dances, some dating from the days of Bagan.
